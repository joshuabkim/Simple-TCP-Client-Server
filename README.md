This repo contains files for a simple client and server using the TCP/IP protocol. It was made using the tutorial on PyMOTW with the intent of learning socket programming and improving my knowledge of the Python Language. I hope to expand on this module to be able to one day create a fully functional client/server for my projects. The Python Module of the Week Tutorial can be found here: https://pymotw.com/2/socket/tcp.html.
